    <description>This library is a Microsoft effort to support cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design.

The C++ REST SDK (codename "Casablanca") is a project to start exploring how to best support C++ developers who want to take advantage of the radical shift in software architecture that cloud computing represents.

This library also gives you a convenient model for composing asynchronous operations. Whether your application is compute-intensive or I/O-driven,  its scalability is likely to require careful resource utilization. Asynchronous APIs are great for scalability,  but can be very hard to use when all you have is C-level functionality. Fortunately,  C++ 11 offers a whole new set of capabilities that can make dealing with asynchronous operations easy,  and the library takes advantage of that throughout.</description>
    <summary>Casablanca is your toolbox for accessing and authoring connected applications using modern C++ features and best practices.</summary>
